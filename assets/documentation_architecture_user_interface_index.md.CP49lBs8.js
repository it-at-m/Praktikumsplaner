Currently, this is done via a snackbar if the interaction was successful, and an error dialog if something went wrong. The error dialog displays the error message sent by the backend so the messages generated in the backend should be comprehensible and really point out what went wrong.</p><h2 id="loading-animations" tabindex="-1">Loading Animations <a class="header-anchor" href="#loading-animations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Loading Animations&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Every time a user has to wait for the completion of a request sent to the backend, a loading animation should be displayed. The application distinguishes between two scenarios. Retreiving data from the backend and providing data to the backend. For the first scenario <a href="#skeleton-loader">skeleton loaders</a> are used, for the second scenario a <a href="#circular-loader">circular loader</a> is used.</p><h3 id="skeleton-loader" tabindex="-1">Skeleton Loader <a class="header-anchor" href="#skeleton-loader" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Skeleton Loader&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The skeleton loader provides a first impression of the site so the user has a slight hint of what to expect when the app is done loading.

This is not only to ensure valid data gets to the backend, but also to provide a good user experience where the user is not able to submit a form until all data meets the requirements. So if the user uses the app as intended, they will get information about invalid data before sending it and getting an error.</p><p>All the rules should match the limitations in the backend and should provide a comprehensible message why the input is invalid.</p>',13),n=[o];function s(d,h,l,c,u,p){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const b=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,b as default};
